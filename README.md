The StarLove hackathon was the first hackathon implemented at WildCodeSchool! We had two days for it. We put into practice our knowledge of working with APIs! The idea was that based on eye color and gender, you could choose a partner for intergalactic travels from the entire list of Star Wars characters, and then add your favorites.
